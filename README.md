## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm a recent graduate from California State University, Fullerton with a B.S. in Computer Science 💻. Currently living in California ☀️, I am open to work and looking for my first entry level software job! I develop mostly in python, but can quickly adapt and learn other technologies if need be!
